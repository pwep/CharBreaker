<H2>CharBreaker</H2>
<p>This program takes a word (or group of words) and calculates on which letter a coordinate (usually a saccade landing point) falls on.</p>
<p>Download <a href="charbreaker_v1_1_3.zip">version 1.1.3 of CharBreaker</a>
</p>
<H3>Assumptions</H3>
<p>The program assumes several things about the text you are trying to break down.</p>
<ul>
<li>The word is centred on a given coordinate, which is adjustable using the x and y offsets.</li>
<li>You have Microsoft Excel (or similar) to read in the generated comma separated variable (CSV) file, or the modified tab separated saccade report.</li>
<li>Saved CSV files will appear in the same folder as the application itself.</li>
<li>Processed saccade reports will appear in the same folder as the original saccade report.</li>
<li>The program tries not to write over files you have previously created, it will apppend a number to the file you are trying to save, if the default filename file already exists</li>
</ul>

<H3>User Guide</H3>
<ol>
<li>Double click the application.</li>
<li>Pick Edit->Font... menu item to change the font being used.</li>
<li>If your font is quite large, you may need to resize the program window.</li>
<li>Type a word or phrase into the text box. There is a maxium of <strong>32</strong> characters allowed.</li>
<li>As you type, under the text box should appear the same word(s) with the following features
<ul>
<li>The red box defines the calculated area of the whole word</li>
<li>The orange lines define the area of each letter (character - even spaces and punctuation have calculated areas</li>
<li>The green line is the computed centre of the word(s). Letter positions are re-computed from the center of this line.</li>
<li>The white circle represents the saccade landing point, if it falls within the area of the word(s)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you have a study where the screen position of the word(s) has been given, enter it into the offset boxes. 
The position of each letter will be re-calculated using the given x and y values as representing the centre of the green line.</li>
<li>If you have a saccade landing point, enter the x and y values into the saccade boxes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Processing a saccade report</h4>
<p>To process a saccade report file (a list of words, their centre coordinates and the saccade landing coordinates) and calculate with letter was hit, you need to generate a saccade report with the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CURRENT_SAC_END_X</strong> - the X coordinate of the saccade landing point</li>
<li><strong>CURRENT_SAC_END_Y</strong> - the X coordinate of the saccade landing point</li>
<li><strong>words</strong> - the word that was displayed</li>
<li><strong>target_loc</strong> - the coordinate of the centre of the word. Here is a valid example: <strong>(292, 380)</strong></li>
</ul>The four variables can appear in any order in the report.</li>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have picked the correct font and font size.</li>
<li>Pick a file to process using the File->Process... menu item.</li>
<li>The program will cycle through each word in the file calculate the letter that has been hit.</li>
<li>The status bar at the bottom of the window will read "processing" while the calculations are being done. It will change to "Ready" once the file has been completely read.</li>
<li>A new tab separated file will have been created that has the letter and leter number appended to each result line.</li>
</ul>

<H4>The CSV file</H4>
<p>A CSV file can be generated about the current text from the File->Dump CSV menu. The CSV contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The word(s) and their overall width and height.</li>
<li>The coordinate you gave to be used as the centre of the word.</li>
<li>For each letter:</li>
<ol>
<li>character name</li>
<li>left edge value</li>
<li>bottom edge value</li>
<li>right edge value</li>
<li>top edge value</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>To Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Catch more file errors - for example if the file to process is already being read in Excel.</li>
<li>Specify the headers to read from the report.</li>
</ul>
