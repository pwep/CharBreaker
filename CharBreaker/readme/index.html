<H2>CharBreaker</H2>
<p>This program takes a word (or group of words) and works out the coordinates of each letter.</p>
<H3>Assumptions</H3>
<p>The program assumes several things about the text you are trying to break down.</p>
<ul>
<li>The font is Times New Roman. Your computer should have it installed by default.</li>
<li>The font size is 14pt.</li>
<li>The font is centred on a given coordinate, which is adjustable using the x and y offsets.</li>
<li>You have Microsoft Excel (or similar) to read in the generated comma separated variable (CSV) file.</li>
<li>Saved CSV files will appear in the same folder as the application itself.</li>
<li>The program tries not to write over files you have previously created, it will apppend a number to the file you are trying to save, if the default filename file already exists</li>
</ul>

<H3>User Guide</H3>

<li>The orange lines define the area of each letter (character - even spaces and punctuation have calculated areas</li>
<li>The green line is the computed centre of the word(s). Letter positions are re-computed from the center of this line.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you have a study where the screen position of the word(s) has been given, enter it into the offset boxes. 
The position of each letter will be re-calculated using the given x and y values as representing the centre of the green line.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Save as CSV</strong> button to generate the CSV file containing the computed letter positions</li>
</ol>

<H3>The CSV file</H3>
<p>The CSV contains the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The word(s) and their overall width and height.</li>
<li>The coordinate you gave to be used as the centre of the word.</li>
<li>For each letter:</li>
<ol>
<li>character name</li>
<li>left edge value</li>
<li>bottom edge value</li>
<li>right edge value</li>
<li>top edge value</li>
</ol>
</ul>
